# üíº Digital Wallet Backend ‚Äì Spring Boot + PostgreSQL

This is a **backend-only** digital wallet system that simulates real-world digital transactions, built using **Spring Boot** and **PostgreSQL**. It supports secure user authentication, wallet funding, peer-to-peer payments, product purchasing, and transaction tracking. Currency conversion is also supported through a live external API.

There‚Äôs no UI here ‚Äî just a clean, well-structured API meant to showcase backend engineering, authentication, and integration practices.

Passwords are securely hashed using **BCrypt** and never stored in plaintext.

## üåê Currency Conversion

To support currency conversion, this app integrates with [https://currencyapi.com](https://currencyapi.com). The wallet internally uses **INR** as the base currency, and users can optionally fetch their balance in another currency like `USD`, `EUR`, etc.
